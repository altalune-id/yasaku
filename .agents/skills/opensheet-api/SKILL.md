description: Read and write a published Google Sheet tab over opensheet's HTTP data plane — auth with an API key, filtered and sorted reads, row CRUD, batch writes, caching and concurrency headers, and the JSON error envelope. Use this whenever calling an opensheet endpoint under /api/v1, minting or scoping an API key for one, debugging a 404, 403, 409 or 412 from a sheet URL, or when the task mentions opensheet, a published sheet, a sheet slug, or "read/write my Google Sheet over HTTP".

# Using the opensheet HTTP API

Every route is scoped to an org, a project and a published sheet slug:

```
https://<host>/api/v1/orgs/<org>/projects/<project>/sheets/<slug>
```

The slug is unique **per project**, not per spreadsheet. Two spreadsheets in one project
cannot both publish `tx`.

## Quick start

```bash
export OPENSHEET_API_KEY='osk_...'          # shown once, at mint time
export S='https://host/api/v1/orgs/acme/projects/main/sheets/tx'

curl "$S" -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENSHEET_API_KEY"                  # all rows
curl "$S?where=status:eq:paid&sort=amount:num.desc&limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENSHEET_API_KEY"                          # filtered page
curl -X POST "$S/rows" -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENSHEET_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Ada","amount":"12"}'  # create
```

Rows are JSON objects keyed by the tab's header row; every value is a string.

Check what a sheet allows before writing to it:

```bash
curl "$S/capabilities" -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENSHEET_API_KEY"
```

It reports `columns`, `idColumn`, `writable`, `softDelete` and `satisfiesContract`
without touching Google.

`columns` is the tab's header row, sorted by name, so it is the same for a tab with no
data rows and for rows with blank trailing cells. `deleted_at` is listed when `softDelete`
is true. The header row is saved when the sheet is published and on every refresh from
Google. A sheet published before opensheet saved header rows, and not refreshed since,
reports the keys of its first live row instead, and `[]` if it has none. The next refresh
fixes this: a read after the cache TTL, or a read after `DELETE /sheets/<slug>/cache`.
After the tab is changed, `columns` uses the new tab's first row until the next refresh.

Because `capabilities` never contacts Google, a header fixed in Google shows up only after
that refresh. To see it at once, purge and read: `DELETE /sheets/<slug>/cache` (needs
`cache:purge`), then `GET /sheets/<slug>`; or wait for the TTL and read once.

## Routes

| Method   | Path                          | Scope                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| GET      | `/sheets/<slug>`              | `sheets:read`                  |
| GET      | `/sheets/<slug>/rows/<id>`    | `sheets:read`                  |
| GET      | `/sheets/<slug>/capabilities` | `sheets:read`                  |
| POST     | `/sheets/<slug>`              | `sheets:write`                 |
| POST     | `/sheets/<slug>/rows`         | `sheets:write`                 |
| POST     | `/sheets/<slug>/rows/batch`   | `sheets:write`                 |
| PUT      | `/sheets/<slug>/rows/<id>`    | `sheets:write`                 |
| PATCH    | `/sheets/<slug>/rows/<id>`    | `sheets:write`                 |
| DELETE   | `/sheets/<slug>/rows/<id>`    | `sheets:write`                 |
| DELETE   | `/sheets/<slug>/cache`        | `cache:purge`                  |
| GET/POST | `/spreadsheets/<id>/tabs`     | `spreadsheets:read` / `:write` |

## Rules that are expensive to get wrong

**A key is shown once.** `POST /apikeys` returns the plaintext at mint time and stores only
an argon2id hash. There is no endpoint that reads it back — lose it and mint a new one.

**Writes need two separate grants.** The key needs `sheets:write` _and_ the sheet itself must
be marked writable in the UI. A key with the scope still gets `403` on a read-only sheet;
`capabilities.writable` tells you which one is missing.

**A key restricted to specific sheets cannot use the `/spreadsheets/.../tabs` routes at all.**
Those authorize project-wide, and a sheet-scoped key is refused there by design.

**Send `Idempotency-Key` on every create.** Retrying without one appends duplicate rows —
the sheet is the store, so there is no unique constraint to catch it.

**Pass `If-Match` on update and delete.** Without it a concurrent writer's change is
overwritten silently. Take the ETag from the read that produced the row.

**Row ids come from an `id` column in the tab**, not from a row number. A tab without one
rejects every by-id route; `capabilities.idColumn` reports this, and the UI offers to add it.

**There is no `401`; a bad key returns `404`.** A missing header, a revoked token, a key from
another project and a slug that does not exist are one indistinguishable answer, so slugs
cannot be enumerated. Never wait for a `401` to detect a bad key — check the key's scopes and
sheet grants before assuming the slug is wrong.

## Verify

`scripts/smoke.sh <base-url> <org> <project> <slug>` reads, filters and inspects one sheet
with `$OPENSHEET_API_KEY`, printing each status. It never writes.
