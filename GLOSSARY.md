# Glossary

One concept, one name. Every entry points at the file or config key that
defines it. Where the repo carries two names for one thing, this file says
which is canonical.

## Surfaces

A **surface** is one way the outside world reaches the app. There are three,
and they all live in one process behind one HTTP listener.

| Term  | Where           | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `web` | `internal/web/` | Browser surface: templ-rendered HTML, HTMX partials, session-cookie auth (`webmw.Session`), i18n middleware, `/static/`.                                                                                                        |
| `api` | `internal/api/` | Machine surface: Connect-RPC (gRPC-compatible + JSON), contracts in `api/*/v1/*.proto` generated into `gen/`, bearer-token auth (`internal/api/interceptor/auth.go` + `tokens.Verifier`), OpenAPI docs. Gated by `api.enabled`. |
| `cli` | `internal/cli/` | Operator surface: Cobra tree, contract in [`docs/CLI_CONTRACT.md`](docs/CLI_CONTRACT.md). Some commands boot the full server graph locally (`ServerBootFn`); others talk to a remote over the API (`ClientBootFn`).             |

NOTE: web and api are **not** peers. `web.NewServer` is also the outer mux — it
owns `/healthz`, `/readyz` and `/robots.txt` unprefixed, mounts the API at
`<basePath>/api/` (`internal/web/server.go:71-72`), and mounts the app itself
(including `/static/`) under `basePath`. The api surface is nested inside the
web one.

## Architecture

| Term             | Where                                     | What it is                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| domain module    | `internal/<name>/`                        | A bounded context with business logic. Shape fixed by [`docs/MODULE_TEMPLATE.md`](docs/MODULE_TEMPLATE.md); reference impl `internal/todo/`.       |
| platform package | see note                                  | A cross-cutting primitive. Shape fixed by [`docs/PLATFORM_TEMPLATE.md`](docs/PLATFORM_TEMPLATE.md).                                                |
| aggregate        | `internal/<name>/<name>.go`               | The root type plus `New(...)` enforcing creation invariants. Mutations are methods on it. No JSON tags.                                            |
| `Store`          | `internal/<name>/store.go`                | The driven port — persistence interface the domain declares and adapters implement. Verbs only: `Save`, `ByID`, `List`, `Delete`.                  |
| `Service`        | `internal/<name>/service.go`              | The driving port — application methods the surfaces call. Holds a `Store`, never SQL.                                                              |
| workflow         | e.g. `internal/user/onboard.go`           | A stateful multi-step operation spanning more than one `Store` or an external system (`OnboardWorkflow`, `invite.SendWorkflow`).                   |
| `Kernel`         | `internal/platform/platform.go`           | The platform bag handed to every service: Pool, PgConn, Log, Reporter, Sessions, Verifier, Mail, AltAuth, Tracer, Meter, Notify, Nano, Caps.       |
| composition root | `internal/boot/`                          | The only place that knows the whole graph. `BootServer` wires Kernel + services + jobs + handlers onto one `worker.Supervisor`.                    |
| `Capabilities`   | `internal/platform/capabilities/`         | Config-derived feature flags handed to templates so views never read config directly.                                                              |
| awareness tag    | `awareness:"..."` on every `Config` field | Declares a field's operational role — `required`, `bootstrap`, `secret`, `mode:<x>`, or `-`. Drives `.env.example` generation and mode validation. |

NOTE: "platform package" is a **category, not a directory**. Some live under
`internal/platform/<name>/` (`config`, `db`, `session`, `tenant`, `tokens`,
`capabilities`, `notify`); others are exported roots (`worker/`, `scheduler/`,
`logger/`, `telemetry/`, `mailer/`, `nanoid/`, `reqid/`, `authl/`).

## Tenancy

| Term                 | Where                                                       | What it is                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| org                  | `internal/org/`                                             | The top tenant. Every tenant-scoped row carries its `org_id`.                                              |
| project              | `internal/project/`                                         | A workspace inside an org. Not itself an RLS boundary.                                                     |
| tenant scope         | `tenant.Context` (`internal/platform/tenant/context.go:11`) | The triple OrgID / ProjectID / UserID carried on `context.Context`.                                        |
| RLS                  | `schema/rls_guard.go`                                       | PostgreSQL row-level security. The app role must be `NOBYPASSRLS`; enforced when `tenant.rlsEnforce=true`. |
| tenant-scoped table  | `schema/tenant_tables_gen.go`                               | A table with an `org_id` column and an RLS policy. Regenerate with `make tenant-tables` after adding one.  |
| `app.current_org_id` | `internal/platform/tenant/pgconn.go:11`                     | The Postgres GUC RLS policies read. Set per transaction via `set_config`.                                  |
| `BeginTenanted`      | `internal/platform/tenant/pgconn.go:22`                     | Opens a transaction with that GUC applied. The only sanctioned way to read tenant data.                    |

Three DB credentials, three jobs:

| Key               | Role                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db.dsn`          | The app. Must be `NOBYPASSRLS`.                          |
| `db.migrator.dsn` | Schema changes only; opened at boot, then closed.        |
| `db.reader.dsn`   | Replica reads. Falls back to the writer pool when empty. |

## Identity and lifecycle

Four names, two concepts. The distinction is **once per deployment** versus
**once per user**.

| Term                   | Where                                                                                | What it is                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| genesis                | `genesis.email` / `genesis.password`                                                 | The built-in first admin, created at boot when no users exist.                                |
| break-glass            | `genesis.breakGlass`                                                                 | Forces local password login to stay reachable even when OIDC is configured.                   |
| **instance bootstrap** | `/onboard`, `OnboardHandler` + `OnboardingGate` (`internal/web/handlers/onboard.go`) | Happens **once for the deployment**: first admin, first org, first project.                   |
| **user acceptance**    | `/welcome`, `WelcomeHandler` + `WelcomeGate` (`internal/web/handlers/welcome.go`)    | Happens **per user**: T&C acceptance + display name. Gated by `compliance.requireAcceptance`. |
| signup completion      | `/signup/complete`, `SignupHandler` (`internal/web/handlers/signup.go`)              | Cloud-only. An OIDC user with no pre-existing membership names their org and first project.   |

NOTE: `/onboarding` (`OnboardingHandler`, `internal/web/handlers/onboarding.go`)
duplicates `/welcome`. It is registered in `internal/boot/http.go`, but nothing
gates it, and its `RequireOnboarded` middleware is unused in production while
still exercised by tests (8 references in
`internal/web/handlers/handlers_test.go`) — so it is unreachable, not dead
code. **Canonical name for the per-user flow is `welcome`.** The duplicate is
left in place deliberately — removing it touches auth flows.

## Scheduling

| Term           | Where                       | What it is                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Runner`       | `scheduler/scheduler.go`    | Owns every `Job`, one goroutine per job, and the shutdown drain.                                                              |
| `Job`          | `scheduler/scheduler.go:50` | One unit of periodic work: `Name`, `Scope`, `Schedule`, `Timeout`, `Singleton`, `Run`.                                        |
| `Scope`        | `scheduler/scheduler.go:24` | `ScopeSystem` (`"system"`) runs once per tick; `ScopeTenant` (`"tenant"`) fans out over every tenant with a tenant-bound ctx. |
| `Singleton`    | `Job.Singleton`             | Take the cross-process lock first; skip the tick if another replica holds it.                                                 |
| `Provider`     | `scheduler/provider.go`     | The zero-arg port a domain's `Scheduler` adapter implements to contribute jobs (`SchedulerJobs() []Job`).                     |
| `Tenants`      | `scheduler/provider.go`     | Enumerates tenants for a `ScopeTenant` job. Impl `tenant.Enumerator`, reading through `tenant.OrgReader`.                     |
| `Locker`       | `scheduler/provider.go`     | Serializes a `Singleton` job across processes. Impl `db.PgLocker` on `pg_try_advisory_lock`.                                  |
| `LocationFunc` | `scheduler/timezone.go:6`   | `func(jobName string) *time.Location` — resolves a job's wall-clock zone.                                                     |
| `Status`       | `scheduler/scheduler.go:34` | Run outcome: `success`, `error`, `overlap`, `not_leader`, `panic`.                                                            |
| `Worker`       | `worker/worker.go:7`        | `Name() string` + `Run(ctx) error` — one long-running loop owned for the process lifetime.                                    |
| `Supervisor`   | `worker/supervisor.go:11`   | Runs every registered `Worker` and shuts them all down together.                                                              |

A `Job` is not a `Worker`: a Worker is one loop that lives as long as the
process, a Job is a unit of periodic work the Runner invokes on a schedule.
`*scheduler.Runner` is itself a `worker.Worker` — it satisfies the interface
structurally, with no adapter and no import of `worker`.

## Deployment

| Term       | Where                                            | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mode       | `mode` (`internal/platform/config/config.go:21`) | `selfhosted` or `cloud`. `Mode.IsProduction()` is derived — it is true only for `cloud`.                                                                                                                                           |
| `basePath` | `http.basePath`                                  | URL path prefix the app is mounted under, e.g. `/app`. Affects routing.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `baseURL`  | `http.baseURL`                                   | Absolute external URL of the deployment. Used for links in mail and the OIDC redirect.                                                                                                                                             |
| `healthz`  | `GET /healthz`                                   | Liveness. DB-independent — always 200 while the process serves.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `readyz`   | `GET /readyz`                                    | Readiness. Returns 503 when the DB health snapshot (`db.HealthMonitor.Ready`) is unhealthy. Boot probes once so the answer is never unset, and the `db-health` worker refreshes it in every replica, independent of the scheduler. |

## Naming

| Term        | What it is                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| module path | `altalune.id/yasaku`                                                                                                                                                                 |
| binary      | `yasaku`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| fork        | Downstream services fork this repo and swap the domain modules. Signatures under the exported roots and `internal/platform/` are copied verbatim, so changing them costs every fork. |

## Business terms

| Term             | Where                        | What it is                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| yasaku           | product                      | The cashflow ledger this repo builds. One ledger lives inside one project; an account may hold several.                                                 |
| wallet (dompet)  | `internal/wallet`            | A place money sits: cash, bank, ewallet, savings, investment or other. Its currency is fixed at creation. Its balance is derived, never stored.         |
| spendable total  | `report.WalletTotals`        | Sum of wallet balances excluding wallets flagged `exclude_from_total`. Savings and investment wallets default to excluded. Shown to the user as "sisa". |
| transaction kind | `transaction.Kind`           | `income`, `expense`, `transfer`, `opening`, `adjustment_in`, `adjustment_out`. Only income and expense carry a category.                                |
| opening          | `wallet.OpenWorkflow`        | The single transaction written when a wallet is created with a starting balance. It is not income.                                                      |
| adjustment       | `transaction.Service.Adjust` | One transaction written to make a wallet match a counted balance. Signed by direction: `adjustment_in` or `adjustment_out`.                             |
| category         | `internal/category`          | A label on income or expense. Its kind is fixed at creation. Archiving frees the name for reuse.                                                        |
| period           | `internal/period`            | One cycle of the ledger. Exactly one per project is current (`end_date IS NULL`, partial unique index). Reports are read per period.                    |
| tutup buku       | `period.Service.Close`       | Closing the books: freeze the period's totals into an immutable `period_closings` row and open the next period the following day.                       |
| payday carry     | `ledger.Settings.StartDay`   | Why periods exist: Indonesian salaries land on a date, not on the 1st, so a period runs payday to payday and a transaction may move to an adjacent one. |
| snapshot         | `period_closings`            | The frozen totals a close wrote. Immutable; recomputed only if the period is reopened and re-closed.                                                    |
| reopen           | `period.Service.Reopen`      | Unfreeze the latest closed period so its transactions can be fixed. Only the latest one qualifies, and its end date stays fixed.                        |
| `Target`         | `api/yasaku/v1`              | The `{org, project}` pair every RPC and MCP tool is scoped by. Auto-selected when the caller has exactly one candidate.                                 |
| resource server  | `internal/mcp`               | yasaku as an OAuth protected resource. Its identifier is `mcp.audience`; bearer tokens must name it (RFC 8707).                                         |
| tool             | `mcp.ToolSpec`               | One MCP-callable operation. Carries a scope (`yasaku:read` / `yasaku:write`) and a mutation flag that forces the two-phase `confirm` contract.          |
